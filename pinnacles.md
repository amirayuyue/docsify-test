## Facility statement <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The NSF-MRI funded Pinnacles cluster is available for all faculty projects at no cost. 

Pinnacles cluster has the following compute node configurations: 
* 40 regular Compute nodes with 2XIntel-28-Core Xeon Gold 6330 2.0GHz - 205W, each with 256GB RAM. 
* 4 High Memory nodes with 2x Intel 28-Core Xeon Gold 6330 2.0GHz CPUs and 1TB RAM for large memory calculations.
* 8 GPU nodes, and each one of the nodes has 2X NVIDIA Tesla A100 PCIe v4 40GB HBM2 Passive Single GPU.
Pinnacles also has ~92TB NFS Fast Scratch Storage space for accessing large data with low latency and 1.5PB of usable long-term storage.

All above nodes are interconnected via HDR InfiniBand w/ RDMA for fast (100Gbits/s) and low latency (sub ms) data transfer.
