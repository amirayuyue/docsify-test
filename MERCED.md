## MERCED cluster <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

MERCED (Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and
Discovery) Cluster is a 2096 core Linux based high performance computing
cluster supported by the National Science Foundation Award
ACI-1429783. The MERCED cluster runs with the [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) operating system,
and employs the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs. a standard flavor of Linux, and employs the Slurm job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs.


## MERCED recharge service <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
!> __MERCED will be a pay-per-use recharge center starting on 1/1/2022.__

With the new NSF-MRI Cluster Pinnacles coming online, we are
transitioning the MERCED cluster to a recharge service (effective
1/1/2022). Users will receive a monthly baseline allocation of 100
cycles and Faculty PIs will be responsible for covering costs that
exceed this baseline. The costs and policies for recharge were
developed with consultation with the Committee on Research Computing
(CoRC) and approved by the campus Recharge Committee.

Starting on 1/1/2022, each current MERCED cluster user will receive a baseline allocation of 100 core-hours<sup>(1)</sup> per month. If users stay below their baseline hours, no charge will occur. However, faculty PIs responsible for the user accounts will be charged monthly for core-hour usage over the baseline allocation.

__Faculty PIs__: Please ensure that the user accounts listed in your
[account](https://merced-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yyu49_ucmerced_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fyyu49%5Fucmerced%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FMERCED%5Frecharge&ct=1639436999554&or=OWA%2DNT&cid=61ce730a%2D0df2%2Dd438%2D7bdf%2Dbe138cf58c23) are accurate
before EOB __12/21/2021__. Email schadalapaka@ucmerced.edu for instructions.

What is the unit and of cost service? MERCED cluster cycles are charged by core-hours.

(1) A core-hour is a single compute core<sup>(2)</sup> used for one hour (a core-hour) and 2G of RAM. The total cost in core-hours for a complete computation is:
```text
Total Cost ($) = # of core-hours x Duration (wall clock hours) x Cost per core-hour
```
(2) A core is an individual processor: the part of a computer that executes programs. (Fun Fact: The MERCED cluster has about 3100 cores.)

For UC users, the cost per core-hour is $0.01 and the cost for non-UC external users is $0.02.

> I don’t want to pay for MERCED what are my options?

Remember, if you stay below or at your baseline allocation, you will not incur any fees. However, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources – and my team can provide consultation for how to access these resources. Schedule a consultation here.

> I have other questions!

We have put together a FAQ page that has the most common questions received and will be keeping it up to date.

Once again, if you have any questions or concerns regarding MERCED
cluster policies. Feel free to reach schadalapaka@ucmerced.edu.
