# Cyberinfrastructure and Research Technologies


UC Merced's <a href=“https://it.ucmerced.edu/CIRT”>Cyberinfrastructure
and Research Technologies (CIRT)</a> team strives to bring research
computing, high-speed networking, and advanced visualization to campus
researchers across all disciplines.

## We are here to help you!

We can help you use supercomputers to work faster, visualize the complexity of your data to work smarter, and collaborate across campus or around the world for broader impacts. We utilize approaches that are flexible enough to accommodate your needs, while still adhering to best-practices which are proven to be effective. We can help you manage the complex relationship between you and the computing technology you use to advance your work.


## Free trainings!
We offer free training and mentoring; drop-in office hours; and consultation services that provide advice on scholarly workflows, equipment purchases, and assistance in using advanced cyberinfrastructure such as the Wide Area Visualization Environment (WAVE), the Science DMZ, or the MERCED Cluster. In partnership with the Library, we also offer a variety of workshops in Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry. We also offer customizable workshops in  GitHub,  Jupyterlab  (aka Jupyter Notebooks), and targeted HPC training.
